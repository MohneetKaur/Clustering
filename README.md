Description:
The goal of this project is to apply clustering techniques using machine learning algorithms to analyze and segment a customer dataset. Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that allows businesses to understand their customers better and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, such as Age, Genre, Spending Score and Annual Income. By applying clustering algorithms, we aim to identify meaningful groups or clusters of customers based on their similarities and differences.
